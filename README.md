Game Hub
========

##### A place for the best HTML5 games on the web

The idea for Game Hub came about after thinking ".. wouldn't it be awesome to have a 'Steam' like library for HTML5 games ..", so I built one. It's a very rough implementation of what I would like the final outcome to be / look like (it's very heavily "bootstrap" at the moment) but it's a step in the right direction. I'd love for this site to be a hive of interest for the best games on the web and also a platform for small developers to spread their name.

### Recommending Games

To recommend games, simply add your game to `GameData.json` following the preset JSON format, and submit a pull request. Once the pull request is accepted your game will automagically be added to the list (the HTML is generated with Moustache.js).

### Getting featured

The method of how getting featured will work still hasn't been settled on yet, but at the moment I'll just add the games I feel are super awesome (using the JSON data).
